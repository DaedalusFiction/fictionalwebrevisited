        "SICKTOOTH was founded in 2022 by failed novelist David Sorensen, who decided that he could do more good in this world by creating a platform on which to publish other writers than he ever could by simply writing things himself. \n\nPublishing fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, and art, SICKTOOTH strives to publish the best content we can find, particulary that by previously unpublished artists and writers. \n\nThe name SICKTOOTH doesn't really have any particular significance; we just thought it sounded cool. Oh, and on that point, we think semicolons are just fine (when used in moderation).",

His stories have appeared in a number of literary magazines, including New Reader Magazine, The Squawk Back, Infinite Rust, and, depending on how gullible you are, Harper's and The New Yorker. His upcoming novel, Unconventional Desire, will probably never actually be released or even finished. \n\nFor anyone who is interested, David's favorite writers include David Foster Wallace, Dave Eggers, Douglas Coupland, Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Mann, T.S. Eliot, and Albert Camus. He also likes trashy memoirs, by anyone.",
